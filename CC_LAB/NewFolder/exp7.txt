Pull the image from Docker to EC2 Instance and access it publicly.

1. go to https://aws.amazon.com, sign in using root user email and password
2. in the console home or dashboard, in the search bar at the top type "EC2"
3. click on the EC2 service
4. in the left side panel, click "instances" under instances
5. you should see your instances here, select any instance
    make sure your imstance image is "ubuntu"
    if not, create a new instance with all the default settings and the OS image as "Ubuntu"
6. right click on it and select "connect", remember or copy your "public ip address"
7. in the console of EC2 instance, type the following commands to pull image:
    sudo su
    apt update (OR) apt-get update
    apt install docker.io (OR) apt-get install docker.io
    docker version
    docker image ls (this shows the list of images present in our instance)
8. we do not have any images because we didnt pull the image from docker
9. type the following commands:
    docker pull scott2srikanth/fileshare_docker-fdp
    docker image ls
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 scott2srikanth/fsdreactdemo
note: 3000:3000
    first 3000 is inbound values, we can change it
    second 3000 is docker bound values, do not change it
    for example: you can give 3008:3000
10. go to your browser and type the public ip of your instance with port number 3000
    public ip is visible in the EC2 console
    http://18.205.24.199:3000 (3000 or 3008 depending on the left side value)
